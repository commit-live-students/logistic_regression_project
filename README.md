# Logistic regression Project

Welcome! This is new project and new tasks at hand. 

**This is Logistic Regression Project**

We are going to do task to strengthen whatever we learned in class of Logistic Regression. 

## What we have learned so far:
- Why Logistic Regression and What is Logistic Regression?
- Hypertuning Parameter
- Gradient Descent 
- Evaluation metrics of Logistic Regression

## What we are going to do?
* You have above data-set. You need to clean this data first.
* After cleaning, you will create a logistic regression model and fit that model on the data.

## What your will learn by doing this assignment ?
- You will learn and perform the preprocessing steps in efficient way and moreover it will give you an idea as to which steps to inculcate while doing preprocessing.
- You will learn the importance of scaling and what effect it has on the model.
- You will learn to build logistic regression model.

### Dataset
To perform Logistic Regression task we will use `Loan Prediction` dataset.  

This dataset contains following features: 
- ApplicantIncome
- CoapplicantIncome
- Loan Amount
- Loan Amount term
- Credit History
- Property_Area
- Self_Employed
- Education
- Dependents
- Married
- Gender
- Loan_ID

**Target Variable:**
- Loan Status

**Details information is mentioned in each task.**

## By completing this task you will be earning 250 points in you training. So, GOOD LUCK!
